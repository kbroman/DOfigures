## R code

- [`do_cross_fig.R`](do_cross_fig.R) - illustration of the generation
  of the DO. At the top, set `black_background=TRUE` if you want a
  black background. The default is to have a white background.

- [`meiosis_func.R`](meiosis_func.R) - R code for simulating meiosis.
  Should be able to use the [R/simcross](http://kbroman.org/simcross)
  package, but `do_cross_fig.R` is still using this old (2003) code.

- [`do_genome_fig.R`](do_genome_fig.R) - illustration of the genome of
  a simulated DO mouse (at G20).
